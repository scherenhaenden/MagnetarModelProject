# Simple Project Demo

This example illustrates how a Magnetar project should look once the canonical model is applied. It tracks the fictional "Telemetry Widget" initiative with partial progress, active blockers, and pending tests.

## Project Snapshot
- **Owner:** Mira Chen
- **Objective:** Deliver a telemetry widget specification using canonical Magnetar workflows.
- **Current Phase:** Process Validation (ms-02)

## Key Artifacts
- `PLAN.md` – Milestones, tasks, estimates, and states.
- `BITACORA.md` – Daily log of decisions, blockers, and merges.
- `project.project.yml` – Machine-readable metadata consumed by automation.
- `STATUS.md` – Health metrics, risks, and next steps.
- `BLOCKERS.md` – Active impediments with mitigation plans.
- `TESTING.md` – Testing commitments and latest results.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` – Component overview and dependency notes.

## How to Use This Example
1. Mirror the structure and tone when drafting your project documents.
2. Compare your task states and progress percentages against the example to ensure consistency.
3. Adapt the YAML file to your project, preserving field names and nesting.
4. Use the bitácora entries as a model for daily logging.

## Progress Overview
- **Overall progress:** 38%
- **Tasks in progress:** 2
- **Open blockers:** 1 (awaiting API contract approval)
